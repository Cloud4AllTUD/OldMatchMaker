First match maker for the Cloud4All project

Generally this is a very small prototype of the whole GPII architecture. This
includes a device profile creator, a plugin structure which represents the
implemented solutions and a match maker although the focus lays on the match
making process.

This prototype is not longer under development, please look at the new MatchMaker
project under https://github.com/Cloud4AllTUD/MatchMaker.git instead.
